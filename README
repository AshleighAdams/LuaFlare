luaserver is a lightweight http server which uses lua for its scripting
language rather than using something such as php, perl or python.

lauch with luaserver port

The main lua file is responsible for controling how the binary handels
the request, so it would be possible to have a structure such as:
	/myprofile/comments?page=1
without /myprofile/comments/index.lua existing and can be fully dynamic,
such as query an SQL server for the page contents (if any).
